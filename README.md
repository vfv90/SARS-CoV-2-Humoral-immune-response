Data for manuscript: "Humoral immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in urban and indigenous children in Colombia"

We worked with two populations: urban children and indigenous. Therefore we have divided this analysis into:
1. Main manuscript: comparing data from indigenous and urban children from March 2021
2. Supplementary Information: comparing data from indigenous and urban children fron March 2021
